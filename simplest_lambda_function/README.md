# Simplest Lambda Function

## Introduction

This is the simplest, most basic AWS Lambda function. The code comes from using the creation template
for a basic Python microservice that uses a Dynamo DB Table. The template created the lambda functionTo make the code simpler, the function
and an API GW for the function. The lambda function is simplified by not containing
the code to access to Dynamo DB. 

On AWS account:
- Lambda function name: ```simplest_lambda_function```
- API GW: ```simplest_api```

## Deployment

For this simple example, I just copy the code into the code window on AWS.
