# Public Examples for E6156 - Topics in SW Engineering: Cloud Computing

## Introduction

This repository contains examples and sample code to help students in
[E6156 - Topics in SW Engineering: Cloud Computing](https://donald-f-ferguson.github.io/E6156-Cloud-Computing-F23/)

## synchronous_asynchronous

This directory contains some example of asynchronous programming for Python using
[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and
[aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/).

__Notes:__
1. Prof. Ferguson still needs to show how to call the async code from within
a FastAPI application. Prof. Ferguson's opinion, however, is that students in a
6000-level CS course at Columbia should have been able to figure all of this
out anyway.
2. Prof. Ferguson needs to add comments to the code.
